Stuff currently has a horrible shell script installer.  This will be
changed in future releases to something a little more conventional and
pleasant to use.  


To Install "Stuff" Tools
------------------------

1.  Uncompress stuff-0.01.tar.bz2
2.  Change into the stuff-0.01 directory
3.  [optional] Edit the "install.sh" file to choose which components 
    to install.
4a. Run this command to install the programs in the default place
    (/usr/local): 
 
   ./install.sh

4b. Or run this command to choose to install to /opt/stuff   

   PREFIX=/opt/stuff ./install.sh


If you install to some area where the perl modules won't be in the
module search path, don't forget to set the PERL5LIB environment
variable so that the modules can be found.  You may also want to add
the location of the manual pages to the MANPATH.  The easiest way to
do this is to add these lines to your shell initialization file.  

For example, if you use "bash", add these lines to your .bashrc file:

  export PERL5LIB="$PERL5LIB:/opt/stuff/lib/perl5/site_perl" 
  export MANPATH="$MANPATH:/opt/stuff/share/man"

Or if you use some csh type shell, add this to the end of your .cshrc
(or whatever file it is for your shell):

  setenv PERL5LIB "$PERL5LIB:/opt/stuff/lib/perl5/site_perl" 
  setenv MANPATH "$MANPATH:/opt/stuff/share/man"



Enjoy,
