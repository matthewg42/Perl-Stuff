Type.pm and related modules
---------------------------

This modules was written as the start of a data-type system for
implementing a simplistic database.  It needs to be overhauled and
some plans made for what to do with it.  The original idea was to
write a pure perl relational database with some SQL features.  For
those poor souls who don't get MySQL databases in their web hosting
packages but like SQL a lot for some reason.

ascbar
------

The idea for the program is to read textual data from standard input
or a file, and write out a ASCII art barchart.  This integrates nicely
with groupby, and could be used to make some quick and dirty, but
visual anaysis of various data.  I did a primitive implementation of a
similar idea at Vodafone D2 and it was a great tool for performance
analysis.

Best illustrated with an example:

Command:

   ascbar --min 0 \
          --max 100 \
          --title="Fruit Ratings" \
          --x-axis-label="% Fruit Satisfaction"

Data:
Apples 10
Oranges 45
Pears 5
Bananas 75
Peaches 23

Output:

                          % Fruit Satisfaction

Gentoo Tools
------------

I've been writing a quick (heavily cached) gentoo query tool for
relieve some of the pain of searching for packages using "emerge -s".
It's not ready yet, but should be soon.  Need to finish it off and add
it to the Stuff Tools.

Tool Finder/Launcher
--------------------

GUI app that gathers information about installed system programs by
looking in the PATH, then for each program, using man / info / KDE
docs / gnome docs / --help -h -? switches etc to get a short
description of each program.  There should then be a launch interface
that allows the user to search (incrementally) the tools by keyword.
All this cos I keep forgetting the name "artsdsp".  :)

Should aggressivley cache usahe data. 

Could use perl/Gtk or perl/Tk or something like that.
