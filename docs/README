Stuff Tools
===========


Introduction
------------

Stuff Tools comprises a bunch of perl modules and utility programs.
There's some useful, erm, stuff in there.  Some examples:

  groupby	- provides statistical aggregation function for 
		  textual input in the unix fiter program tradition.
  sq, dq        - trivial quoting programs to help use find & xargs
		  with filenames that contain whitespace.  
		  sq=single quote, dq=double quote.
  ascii2morse   - you want to type out morse code with a qwerty 
		  keyboard, right?
  sumup		- adds up numbers in the unix filter style.  Outputs
		  statistical operations on set - sum, mean etc.
		  also can output is proper byte units like KiB
  dms2dec	- degrees, minutes and seconds to decimal.  Useful
		  for people who make angular measurements.
  
These are only really examples of how to use the perl modules.  The
modules contain a variety of nice utility functions including, but not
limited to:

  * convenient and flexible pretty debugging output
  * keep pod docs in your programs and generate usage info directly
    - no need to maintain two files.  Yes this is more of less the
    same as doing "pod2text ... $0", but a lot cleaner to use.
  * operations on numerical ranges
  * tabular output of data (alternative to perl "write" which is
    better for some kinds of data)
  * morse code parsing and conversion, including American Morse 
    dialect (something the existing CPAN morse modules don't do)
  * CSV creation and parsing from an to arrays.  With proper escaping 
    of quotes and delimiters.


How you can help
----------------

Since Stuff Tools are in a pretty early stage of development, one of
the easiest and best ways of helping to to provide feedback.  For now
this just means emailing the author (see below for details).

However, it would also be great to contribute code, bug reports or
documentation.


History
-------

Stuff utilities was borne out of the frustration derived from
re-implpementing the same old perl bits and bobs each time I started a
new contract.  I've developed some useful little gizmos over the years
and it's annoying that each time I start a new contract I have to
implament a-fresh (since implementations for one employer usually
belong to them).

So I decided to implement this little toolset so that I can use it as
a generic base which I can then specialize for new customers.  The way
I've set out the licensing should mean that I can use the generic
parts distributed here, but use them as a base to write code that is
OK for customers to keep and use as they wish without the more
restrictive aspects of some licensing models..

All code in this project is a clean-room implementation - I was not
employed by anyone to write any code distributed in the Stuff Tools.
