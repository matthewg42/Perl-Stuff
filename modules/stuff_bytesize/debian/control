Description: convert numbers to n-byte sizes (e.g. KiB)
 Here you can convert from a [possibly very large] number of bytes into some
 more managable unit such as Gigi-bytes. Well, almost. Many programmers are
 guilty of doing the calculation incorrrectly, and almost all don't use the
 proper nomenclature.
 .
 The proper (SI standardized) names and quantities are described here:
 http://physics.nist.gov/cuu/Units/binary.html. Stuff::ByteSize inplements
 convertsion between quantities of bytes and some confortable binary
 multiples.
 .
 So now you know!
