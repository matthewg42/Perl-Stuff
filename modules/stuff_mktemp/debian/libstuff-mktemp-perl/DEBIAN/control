Description: Stuff::Mktemp
 Stuff::Mktemp began life as a habit of writing my own mktemp function in
 shell scripts on some old Solaris boxen where the system mktemp was buggy.
 Since then I got addicted to auto-cleanup of temp files, and so this module
 continues that suspect practise.
 .
 The module keeps track of temporary files that are created by calling the
 mktemp() function. When cleanup_temp_files() is called they are unlinked if
 they still exist. It's probably a good idea to trap various signals that
 might kill you program and have your sigtrap function call
 cleanup_temp_files().
