Description: (no short description found)
 Stuff::RelPath is used to generate relative paths for the creation of
 symbolic links. It does no filesystem checking at all - it is simply
 processing strings. Therefore it doesn't know if the paths you provide are
 existing or not on the system - you need to mkdir -p the dirname of the
 symlink if it doesn't exist, and all that good stuff.
