Description: Stuff::Range
 Stuff::Range is an object module that models simple numeric ranges. Each
 range has an upper and lower value. Various things may be done to ranges,
 including checking if a value falls with the range, merging with other
 Stuff::Ranges, testing if a range is bound by another range and so on.
