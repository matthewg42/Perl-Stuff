Description: Fixed width character table printing class
 Stuff::Table provides an alternative to perl form output for some simple
 tabular formats. A Stuff::Table object contains description of table columns.
 It may then be fed data and will return correctly formatted rows of output
 for use as the programmer wishes. Note that this is only going to be useful
 for use on fixed-width-font terminals and the like, and the output isn't
 exactly beautiful. Still, it's good for knocking together quick reports.
